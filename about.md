I'm a data scientist, former psychologist with neuroscience background and experience in UX research.

My PhD focused on designing experimental and computational methods to explain how human brain processes ðŸ’°lucrativeðŸ’° locations in the 2D visual space using real-time eye trackingðŸ‘€. These days I'm happier to apply my skills to projects outside the lab. I've worked on projects in classification, [regression](https://zuzannna.github.io/Healthy-Trees/), [clustering](https://zuzannna.github.io/Wikipedia-Users/), [NLP](https://zuzannna.github.io/VanGo/), [recommender systems](vango, gardening), time series, [A/B testing](https://zuzannna.github.io/ETL/), [geospatial analysis](https://zuzannna.github.io/Giving-Tuesday/), [event-logging](https://zuzannna.github.io/Wikipedia-Users/) and [web scraping](https://zuzannna.github.io/VanGo/).

As a Data Science Fellow at [Insight](http://insightdatascience.com) within 3 weeks I implemented and validated an engine which uses NLP and principal component analysis (PCA) to produce recommendations of artworks based on curatorial descriptions. Feel free to play around with a prototype hosted on AWS using Flask [here](http://vango.hopto.org) and if you feel like reading a bit more, [here](https://www.slideshare.net/ZuzannaKyszejko/zuzannaklyszejkovango) is a short presentation.

My undergraduate background is in cognitive neuroscience with a minor in human-computer interaction. I love participating in hackathons (in fact, I organized one [recently](wimldsdatadive.com/hackathons/2)) and I am passionate about science outreach - I volunteered for years all around NYC teaching neuroscience in elementary schools. Feel free to reach out to me about data science, experimental design, user testing or eye tracking and browse my [github](https://github.com/zuzannna).
