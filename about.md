What makes our brains tick? My PhD research explored the idea that we are driven to focus on certain areas of our surrounding while ignoring the others. What determines this trade-off and to what extent can we predict it? I investigated these questions with a mixture of computational modeling and experimentation, focusing on oculomotor decision making. 

As a Data Science Fellow at Insight I applied my skills to design, implement and validate an engine which uses natural language processing to produce recommendations of artworks based on curatorial descriptions. You can play with it [here](http://vango.hopto.org) and got through [this](https://www.slideshare.net/ZuzannaKyszejko/zuzannaklyszejkovango) short presentation to find out more about the details.

Feel free to reach out to me about data science, experimental design, user testing and eye tracking or browse my github at https://github.com/zuzannna.
